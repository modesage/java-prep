encapsulation means wrapping up of implementation of data members
and the methods inside a class.

putting stuff inside classes and then hiding it by using,
public, private, protected

encapsulation is the process of containing the info.

it basically hides the code and data into a single entity or unit,
so that it can be protected from the outside world.  

it focuses on internal stuff

eg- when you are working on a feature or package
you make a class and define some variables and methods inside it.
you are encapsulating the data and methods inside the class.

after that the abstraction part will use that thing.

DATA HIDING FOCUSES ON DATA SECURITY AND ENCAPSULATION FOCUSES ON HIDING THE COMPLEXITY OF SYSTEM
DATA HIDING ALWAYS PUT IT AS private.
DATA HIDING IS ACHIEVED VIA encapsulation.
ENCAPSULATION IS A sub process IN DATA HIDING.
