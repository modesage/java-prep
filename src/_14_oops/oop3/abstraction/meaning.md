abstraction means hiding the unnecessary details but
only showing essential info.

done by using abstract class and interfaces.

abstraction is the process of gaining the info. 

it focuses on external stuff

eg- System.out.println()

so here we dont care what is happening inside the methods
or how are they defined or inside the class.
we just use it.
