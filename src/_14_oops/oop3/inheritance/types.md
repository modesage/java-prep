types of inheritance
* single inheritance(one class extends to one sub-class)
* multi-level inheritance(one class extends to one sub-class, then one sub-class extends to one sub-class2)
* multiple inheritance(not supported in java)(multiple classes extends to same sub-class)
* hierarchical inheritance(one class inherited by many classes)
* hybrid inheritance(not in java)(combination of single and multiple inheritance)
