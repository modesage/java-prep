types of polymorphism
* compile time/ static - achieved by method overloading
* runtime/ dynamic - achieved by method overriding. during runtime DYNAMIC METHOD DISPATCH occurs to call the specific method. the ref variable will tell which it can access and the object type will tell which method to call, it is done by UPCASTING.
